**Example Servless Azure Application**
==================
This repository is a simple example of a Serverless Architecture using Azure Functions, MongoDB Atlas, and 2 IoT Client Applications. All Servless Functions were implemented in JavaScript. The example IoT Reporting application was written in Angular JavaScript. The example IoT Embedded application was written in Python and running on a Raspberry Pi 3 Model B and a SenseHAT board.

What is a Serverless Architecture?

<i>"Serverless architectures are application designs that incorporate third-party “Backend as a Service” (BaaS) services, and/or that include custom code run in managed, ephemeral containers on a “Functions as a Service” (FaaS) platform. By using these ideas, and related ones like single-page applications, such architectures remove much of the need for a traditional always-on server component. Serverless architectures may benefit from significantly reduced operational cost, complexity, and engineering lead time, at a cost of increased reliance on vendor dependencies and comparatively immature supporting services."</i>
